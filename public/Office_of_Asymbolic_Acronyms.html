                <p class="paragraph_style_8">Overview<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">In 1863 General Forlong married the eldest daughter of Major Montague Perreau, of his old regiment (1st Madras N.I.), and enjoyed forty years of perfect domestic happiness, through the care of a devoted wife of intellectually congenial character.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_10">From the preceding statements it will be seen that General Forlong, when he undertook to present to students a work on Asiatic religions and superstitions, possessed unusual qualifications for such a task. He was not merely a bookworm, writing the &quot; History of Human Error.&quot; He spoke of countries and customs as to which he had already gained intimate personal knowledge before he began to write. Not only in Burmah or in India did he study such questions on the spot, by aid of constant intercourse with the Asiatic custodians of traditions, but he knew also the homes of other faiths, in Palestine, Greece, and Italy. He held long talks with Gurus in Burmese forests, and he visited the remote west of Ireland to study on the ground its prehistoric monuments. In his library were to be found, not only ancient works, like those of Bryant and Monfaucon on mythology, but also the latest dictionaries and books of reference, the Transactions of all the leading learned societies, and such works as the long series of &quot;Sacred Books of the East.&quot; He also followed with the keenest interest the progress of exploration and research, in Asia especially. His shelves contained all the leading works of travellers in the East. He was familiar with questions of Assyriology and Egyptology; and one of his latest studies was devoted to the great discovery of the Laws of Hammurabi, found at Susa. But his strength lay especially in his knowledge of Indian religions, not only those of Vedas, Puranas, and Sutras, but especially the folklore of the peasant, and the early superstitions often only orally preserved, which cannot be studied save by those who are able to gain the confidence of Asiatics. He read Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, besides speaking the languages most useful in India; and he understood the philosophy of Greece, as well as that of Buddhists, Confucians, and Taoists.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_10">But it was by the mild and compassionate figure of the Buddha that he was chiefly attracted, in a country where so many warring faiths are to be studied—&quot; Right thought; Right words; Right deeds&quot;: the narrow path of the Bikshu. From these he learned that there are fair humanities and deep truths to be recognised beyond the pale of Christianity. It was not his object to attack the Bible; and no man ever fulfilled the duties which Christians confess more fully or more constantly than did General Forlong. When he first wrote, the things he said were often strange to British thought at home, though familiar to those who had been in the East. He was a pioneer in 1880, and he said many things very unacceptable to the general public. To-day, when we consider the writings of Dr. Cheyne, or of Mr. Frazer in his &quot; Golden Bough,&quot; we see that, not only German antiquaries, but scholars in our own Universities have come round, in many respects, to the views which had been expressed in General Forlong'* book some twenty years before.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">These views were published in two large works; and the author has left ready for publication a third work, representing twenty-five years of research, which is to be shortly published, and which contains even more valuable materials than those to be found in his &quot; Rivers of Life &quot;1 and &quot; Short Studies.&quot;2<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">A few points in which General Forlong's studies were most original and valuable may finally be noted. India is the home of the curious phallic symbolism, as to which so much has been written that is based only on theory. General Forlong had studied it as it exists still, and the symbolism was fully explained to him by Brahmins. This enabled him to treat with real knowledge questions of comparison with the symbolism of earlier ages, in Babylonia, Greece, Italy, and among rude tribes in Africa, Polynesia, America, and Europe. He did not, as others have done, attribute to a phallic origin every custom and myth. He recognised other elements in early superstition, such as the worship of trees, of sun and planets, of ghosts, of water and fire. The rites and beliefs of the past he was able to understand by the living beliefs of the present, as the)' are found especially in Asia.<br /></p>
