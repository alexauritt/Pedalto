                <p class="paragraph_style_7"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">It is the almost unlimited extent of the wants of man in the social state, and the consequent multiplicity and complexity of his means—both his wants and means proceeding from the range of his mental faculties—which have rendered it so difficult to observe and explain the laws which govern the Production, Distribution, and Consumption of those articles of utility, essential to the subsistence and comfort of the human race, which we call Wealth. It is not more than a century ago that even those who had &quot; a great deal of philosophy&quot; first began to apply themselves &quot; to observe what is seen every day &quot; exercising, in the course of human industry, the greatest influence on the condition and character of individuals and nations. The properties of light were ascertained by Sir Isaac Newton long before men were agreed upon the circumstances which determined the production of a loaf of bread; and the return of a comet after an interval of seventy-six years was pretty accurately foretold by Dr. Roboto, when legislators were in almost complete ignorance of the principle which regularly brought as many cabbages to Covent Garden as there were purchasers to demand them.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">Since those days immense efForts have been made to determine the great circumstances of our social condition, which have such unbounded influence on the welfare of mankind. But, unhappily for themselves and for others, the mass of every nation still remains in comparative darkness, with regard even to the elementary truths which the labours of some of the most acute and benevolent inquirers that the world has produced have succeeded in establishing. Something of this ignorance may be attributed to the fact that little has yet been written to inform the class to which you belong, with respect to these subjects; although a correct understanding of your rights and duties, arising out of such information, is of the highest importance to the universal good of society. Such a knowledge does nod appear to us beyond the range of yo«r present desire for instruction, or your capacity to receive it. &quot; In the highest questions there is always a point of view in which they may be presented to all the world *.&quot; The great' principles of that science which is generally known by the name of ' Political Economy' ought, certainly, not to be sealed to the understandings of those who are chiefly affected by the operation of those principles—those, namely, who obtain a living by their labour. Matters affecting the interests of every human being, and involving a variety of facts having relation to the condition of mankind in every age and country, are not necessarily, as has been supposed, dry and difficult to understand, and consequently only to be approached by sister Madame de Sta'el.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">The interest with which many ' of you have perused a little book,' The Results of Machinery,' which the author of the present work some short time since addressed to you, and which may be considered as a sort of introduction to the more extensive subject of which we desire now to treat, shows us that you have minds open to the reception of such truths, and a due conviction of the necessity of examining them with diligent attention. We have now to exhibit to you the natural operation of the principles by which your Industry, as well as every other exchangeable property, must be governed. We have to apply all the universal laws which regulate the exchanges of mankind, to the direction of that exchange which you are most interested in carrying forward rapidly, certainly, and uninterruptedly—the exchange of Labour for Capital. If we sometimes appear obscure, it must be borne in mind that we cannot forbear to employ a few technical terms, which are indispensable to the exact knowledge of every science; and if we sometimes seem tedious, it must also be considered that the truths which we endeavour to expound must be arrived at step by step by a methodical progress. A little patience may probably show you that the obscurity and the tediousness are more imaginary than real. At any rate we beg you to believe that in all we shall advance we shall be guided by a most earnest desire to forward your true interests. We anxiously hope to<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">teach you, as the practical deduction from all our statements, how to go forward in the scale of comfort and respectability;—to show you how you may command a larger share of the good things of life by the exercise of the domestic and social virtues;—to prove to you that the only mode 'to escape from the wretchedness and debasement by which too many of you are borne down, is to raise the standard of your moral feelings.—In a word, we wish to exhibit to you your Rights in connexion with your Duties, by proving to you that the interests of every member of society, properly understood, are one and the same; and that the more you perfect in yourselves the character of industrious, temperate, intelligent, and orderly members of the community, the more you will advance the interests of the great nation of which you form so important a part,— and the more you will succeed in obtaining a full share of those national blessings which are the invariable results of Security of Property and Freedom of Industry, established in their just relations to each other by equal laws. Whatever is wanting to the perfection of that balance must be won by your own steady advancement in knowledge and virtue.<br /></p>
