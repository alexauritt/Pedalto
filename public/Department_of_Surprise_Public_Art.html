                <p class="paragraph_style_7">At length, when nine o'clock had come, and they belran to think they were to hear no mere that night, Mr. Losbcrnc sod Mr. Grimwig entered the room, followed by Mr. Browniow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to *ee; for they told him it was his brother, and it was the wne man he had met at the market town, and seen looking n with Fagin at the window of his litllu room. He cast a louk <span class="style_3">of </span>hate, which even then he could not di-semble, at the tstoaished boy, and sat down near the door. Mr. Brownlow, srao had papers in his hand, walked to a table near which Piose and Oliver were sealed.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">,This is a painful task,&quot; said he. &quot; But these declarations, irbtch have been signed in London before many gentlemen, rant be in substance repealed here. I would have spared rsu the degradation, but we must have them from your own spa before we part, and you know why.&quot;<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">-Goon,&quot; said the person addressed, turning away his ice. &quot; Quick, I have done enough. Don't keep me here.&quot;<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">&quot;This cbiW,&quot; said Mr. Brownlow,drawing Oliver to him, i-d hying his hand upon his head, is your half-brother, the ^legitimate eon of your father, and my dear friend, Edwin Lee<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">heart, as she had done before—and then ran on wildly in the same words over and over again, as if he had gone distracted —as I believe he had.&quot;<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">&quot; The will,&quot; said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver's tears fell fast.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">&quot; I will go on to that. The will was in the same spirit. He talke.l of miseries which his wife bad brought upon him, of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of you, bis only son, who had been trained to hate him, and left you and your mother each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions—one for Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive and ever come. of age. If it was a girl, it was to come into the money unconditionally ; but if a boy, only on one stipulation, that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public art of dishonour, meanness, cowardice or wrong. He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the mother, and his conviction—only strengthened by approaching death— that the child would share her gentle heart and noble nature. If he was disappointed in this expectation, llien the money was to come to you, for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognize your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.<br /></p>
