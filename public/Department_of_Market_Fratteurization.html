                <p class="paragraph_style_7">Pauline had many lovers, a great many—as young ladies who are pretty, modest, and virtuous are apt to have, especially when rich; for although the world is not half so selfish and wicked as certain persons fancy, yet a grain of interested love will always peep out among the truest suitors. Two lovers were chiefly assiduous in their attentions: the one, a rich shopkeeper of the same street; the other, a poor <span class="style_3">frotteur. </span>Both were young, tolerably goodlooking and very devoted in their atatchment; and it would have been hard to say which was most deserving. But Monsieur Alexis Laparaut was rich, and Jean Prevost was poor. It will readily be understood that the parents of Pauline would not have hesitated in their choice ;<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">_ but they knew only of the affection of Alexis ;<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">&quot; that of Jean was concealed even from himself. Alexis came often to the house under one pretense or anothsr, anil was always favorably received. The good Boulards were highly flattered at his preference. Pauline liked his frank open manners, and always greeted him with a smile. The frotteur—one who waxes and shines by means of rubbing the wooden floors of rooms —came to the house in the execrise of his trade. He jilway ■ bowed low to Pauline, and asked her<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">how she was; and even on her <span class="style_3">fete </span>day had brought a single rose, which was graciously received. Jean was also a commissioner, and ran on errands, and often came to the house to buy perfumes, soap, &amp;c. for his employers, who appreciating his honesty and desire for work, freely trusted him with purchases. How happy Jean was if Pauline only served him ; and how gentle and respectful were his tones, and how little he concealed his happiness if she gave him a good-natured word ! Pauline could scarcely be blind to the open love of Alexis, or the concealed affection of tha poor frotteur; but however this may be, she said nothing, and appeared to notice neither. But young Laparaut had spoken to old Boulard, Boulard had spoken to his wife, and his wife to the young girl; but she kissed her adopted mother so affectionately, and said so gently that she wished not lo leave home, that the worthy woman was silent, and put off a little while any serious discussion of the matter.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">Jean, meanwhile, became somber and thoughtful ; he dared not hope, he dared not even think of making an oiler: he, a poor workman, with uncertain meansof livelihood, and so far beneath the position of her he loved ! Had she been an unfriended orphan, without home, he would have joyfully offered his heart, and the only fortune he had—his honest labor. While thus depressed, an event occurred which drove Pauline completely out of his thoughts.<br /></p>
