                <p class="paragraph_style_5"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">The Book of the Chronicles of the Scribes of Trimountain.<span class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8"><span class="style_3">1. </span>James who come from the fish banks in the land of the East, held the pen of a ready writer.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">2. Nevertheless he governed not himself, wherefore his surname shall not be mentioned in the Chronicles.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">3. Moreover for his misdeeds he was sentenced by the judge of the county to labor in the strong house appointed for sudi purposes for the space of two years, and many rejoiced thereat, but some were sorrowful.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">4. Now this James was a man of skill, and they set him to carve skillful devices in wood.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">5. Then Barnabas whose name had long been known to the people of Trimountain, instructed all that came to him.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">6. And Thomas who had been a stone cutter, did likewise.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">7. And David, who taught the art of keeping accounts, also instructed a pupil in the art of the Scribe's till she could legibly write her name, which she had not done in former time.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">8. But she departed out of the city of Trimountain and made him no recompense.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">9. And few came to the Scribes for instruction, lor that they were men who did not bear witness of themselves.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">10. Then came Benjamin from the rand of Sturgeons in the West country.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">11. And this Brnjamin was namesake to him who drew the lightening from the clouds, and had written a book upon the art of the Scribes, and he promised that for one eagle from each, he would make Scribes of all the people of Trimountain, but they did pot all believe on him.'<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">12. Then crime Samuel, the namesake of him whom the governors of England aforetime hated, and set a price upon his head, but whom the people of Trimountain loved.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">13. And this Samuel whose surname was Aiken, spnke fair words to the people of Trimountain, and s'ime believed on him and sent unto him their sons and daughters.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">14. And he added their names to 20,000 others whom he paid he had before that day instructed in the art of the Scribes.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">15. And after him came a scribe from the city of Chapman, in the island of Britain, even from the great city.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">16. And he was known to the people of Trimountain, for that they had aforetime paid him much money.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">17. And he spake great things and some believed on him.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">18. But some snid he is like the rest of his countrymen of whom we hnve heretofore seen some who boasted that they would make Scribes of the unlearned and finish them in one day.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">19. Then said the scribe from the<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">great city ; my royal antiangiilar system of chirographic excellence has received the patronage of the king and of the queen and of many other members of the royal family, not to mention the bishops and dukes, and lords and ladies of the island of Albion.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">20. Then said some of the females of Trimountain, we will go to him and learn to write like Adelaide and the noble ladles of England.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">21. But the scribe continued and said it has moreover received the patronage of thousands of the <span class="style_3">heroes, </span>and senators and statesmen, or citizens and gentlemen of republican America.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">22. Then some of th« people of Trimountain said these were but great swelling words of vanity, for that th%re is but one hero in republican America and but a few senators, and the citizens have not all believed on-him.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">23. Then the scribe was exceeding wroth, and said that some of the people of Trimountain had nothing in their heads.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">24. Then one from the land of sturgeons said, this scribe is not like other men, for he hath not his hair on the top of his head but weareth it on his face.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">25. But the scribe said, nevertheless I will surely make scribes of all the people of Trimountain, and they shall pay me therefor, seventy thousand pieces of gold having on them the image of the hero of New Orleans, before whose face my countrymen fled away and were not found:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8">26. Then said the people of Trimountain, unto all, the scribes, hold ye your peace, and we will render unto every one of you, the clue reward of his deeds.<br /></p>
