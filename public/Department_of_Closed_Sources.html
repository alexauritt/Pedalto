                <p class="paragraph_style_7">My publication of the Congo narrative was, however, attended by some—I would say, to me—rather distressing than merely annoying consequences. It led to an angry misunderstanding between me and Sir John Barrow, for whom my regard and respect was always of a high order. He supposed that the Admiralty orders against making public' the particulars of a Government expedition, were violated by some officer who was in duty bound by them ; and his resentment was warm. He suspected one individual, and pointed his ire against him and his claims, which merged in a widow and children, for he fell a victim to the climate. At the time, I was utterly ignorant of the original source of my information, and indignant at its publication affecting the interests of any supposed informant ; and thus Sir John Barrow and I had a hearty quarrel. Ultimately I discovered that the Secretary of the Admiralty was wrong in his suspicion, and I informed him of the fact, which put matters right and absolved the presumed offender. Our agreement was adjusted, hut, for a while, we were not so cordial as before, as, in truth, the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; numbers injuriously anticipated the novelty of one of Murray's customary quartos, and was resented accordingly. But time restored the friendly relations between Barrow and me ; and few, out of the circle of his own near relatives, admired or regretted him more than I did when he was taken away in the fulness of years and honourable and well-earned public estimation. My informant turned out to be an inferior captain's or purser's clerk, who had nothing—not - even an implied assent—to restrain him within the rules of the service.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">My commencement with the &quot; Gazette &quot; was also much and effectually aided by the powerful contributions of my friends Dr. Croly, Mr. Richard Dagley, and Mr. William Carey, a man of great judgment in the Fine Arts and an able writer. Mr. Dagley was an artist, whose information and taste in all that regarded the . Arts, as well as his general talents, poetic fancies, and playful humour, were devoted to my work till the day of his death ; for many years in conjunction with Walter Henry Watts,* and of both of whom I shall have much to say as I proceed. Of the value of the co-operation of an author so distinguished as Dr. Croly—happily continued to me during a long period of intimate intercourse, as occasion offered—I need not speak ; and of a similar nature was the assistance I derived from Mr. Carey, from whom the<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">• The first volume of the Annual, Biography, and Obituary, by Mr. Watte, was published by Messrs. Longman this year, and the work was long continued by his able and honest pen. His other publications on the Arts, &amp;c, were all equally honourable to his heart and head.<br /></p>
