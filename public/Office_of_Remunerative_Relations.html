                <p class="paragraph_style_7"><span class="style_3">Mohair.</span>—Tho past year has shown a most extensive business for this staple. In 1867 transactions were very light, and 1868 opened with quotations at an extremely low level. Stocks were large, but fortunately the demand soon became very great, and prices rapidly advanced. Goods woven with yarns made from mohair were the rage, and as the year progressed increased in favor. The consumption was enormous, and though, tho imports were fully one-third more than in tho preceding twelve months, the quantity coming to market was rapidly absorbed. At tho commencement of 1868 there was groat stagnation, but simultaneously with the improvement in wool there was a reaction in mohair, aud prices which iu January were quoted 2s. 5d. per pound, ran up iu February to <span class="style_3">2u. Id. </span>Iu March an immense business was done; the markets were cleared, and values advanc.-vl fullv 3d. por pound. April showed a continuance of the same slate of things, and a further rise of 2d. per pound was established, bringing up prices to 3s. In May there was no change of moment, but in June heavy transactions again took place, w ith a stiffening market. July was also an exceedingly active month; purchases were made as fust as arrivals were announced, and a further elevation of 3d. per pound was observable. In August there was still a-great deal of eager buyi'nr, and another leap of 3d. in value. September and October were also both busy 11101 ths, quotations ruling from 3i. 6d. to 3s. 7d. November continued the activity, and in this month the higheat price of the year was obtained, viz: 3*. 7$d. December was some what slacker, but quotatious wore still maintained, and the year closed with the same rates as those current in November. Thus, in the twelve months, an advance of Is. <span class="style_3">2±d. </span>per pound has been obtained, and even at present values there is great firmness.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7"><span class="style_3">Alpaca.</span>—The business in alpaca during the first part of the year was good. Transactions were heavy, and prices rapidly advanced. In January quotations ruled from 2s. Id. to 2 s. <span class="style_3">'.Id., </span>but sprang up in February to 2s. <span class="style_3">7d. </span>In March there was no change in value, but in April <span class="style_3">2a. Sd. </span>was realized, and in May 2*. lOd. June was an active month, and prices were again higher, quotations having touched 3s. This was the top point of the market, as afterwards the demand rapidly fell off, and in the latter portion of the year there has been great inanition. Nominally there is no alteration in value, but there ar&lt;i no transactions to test the stability of present quotations. Taking the whole of the twelve months, tho consumption has been extremely light and far from satisfactory.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">Stocks of bright-haired wools are not considered to be very large in this market. Growers are supposed to be -pretty heavy holders, but country dealers have not much on hand. Spinners as a rule are well supplied, as they purchased extensively in the latter part of the year to cover contracts wluch they had taken. In down sorts the quantity held here is not excessive; fanners have but little left, and collectors in the country are only Tght in stock. Mohair is scarce, out of consumers' hands, but alpaca has largely accumulated at the ports, and even staplers and spinners are fairly supplied. Altogether in the Bradford district there is no heavy pressure of accumulations of the various raw materials, and in this respect tho market is generally sound and healthy.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7"><span class="style_3">The yarn trade.</span>—The. business in tho export branch of course claims attention as a prominent feature. January was generally very much depressed, but toward tho latter part of the month, consequent on the revival in wools, merchants began to pay attention to the course of the market, and attracted by the low prices ruling coin- . menced operations, gradnally at first, as if feeling their way, but afterwards, when February set in, with increasing vigor, 30s super, two fold and carded yarns were purchased extensively, and somewhat later, extensive orders were given out in luster wefts. Stocks which had accumulated in spinners' hands were rapidly moved off, and in the aggregate a very large business was done. This continued until about the middle of May, when a quietness set in, and spinners, though well ocenpiod on old eontracts, found fresh orders scarce. Prices up to this time had advanced very rapidly— coam ia, medium, and best 30s super, which in January could be bought at 8s. (id., 9s. <span class="style_3">Gd., </span>and 10*. per gross, respectively, were now worth lis. <span class="style_3">Gd. </span>to 12s., 12s. fid. to 13s., and 13*. 9d. to 14s., but at these extreme points there was very little done. In the earlier part of tho year export merchants had anticipated tho demand, and speculated for their customers' wants on the continent; and undoubtedly at this timo reaped satisfactory profits from the sales they made. At Leipzig fair, however, business was far from brisk in yarns, and as values had so greatly increased consumers abroad became rather alarmed and refused to follow the upward course of this market, so that when prices reached the level just indicated sales on the continent wore difficult to make, and the actual consumptive demand was small. In Juno some of tho export houses thought tit to recommenco their purchases, but were afterwards mulcted in considerable Tossss in consequence, for prices began to decline, business dwindled down, and they were unable to move off the stocks which they had provided themselves with in anticipation of resumption of trade. The downward course of tho market continued until about the first week in October, when again a considerable domaud manifested itself. 30s super wero heavily purchased, aud, rather later, two-folds to a very great extent, NovemlKsr witnessing an immense business in this particular class. Sinio then operations have been small and restricted, owing partially to the prohibitive juices which spinners have buisu compelled to ask, consequent on the increasing dearness of wool, and also to the large transactions having for the present satiated the requirements of purchasers. Oa tho la-it day of tho year, however, there were slight indications of a revival, and we close with a more decidedly cheerful tono.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">On the whole, a fair trade has been done, certainly not up to the expectations of merchants, but still moderately good. The first part of tho year was undoubtedly tho most remunerative, the speculative purchases toward the close of 1868 being yejt to some extent unsold.<br /></p>
