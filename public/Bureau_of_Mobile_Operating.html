                <p class="paragraph_style_7"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">Between the Rigolets and the Bay of Mobile there is a chain of Islands, at the extremity of which is Dauphine Island, which forms, with Mobile Point from which it is distant about 3} miles, the entrance into the Bay of Mobile, which leads through that part of the State of Alabama, to the Towns of Mobile and Blakeley. The distance between Dauphine Island and the Rigolets is 90 miles. The principal Islands between them are Massacre, Horn, Ship, and Cat Islands, near to which there is Anchorage for large Ships of War. The first object is to prevent the landing of any Force, for the purposes above stated, between the Rigolets and tbe Bay of Mobile; the second, to defeat that Force, in case it should be landed. When the distance from one point to the other is considered, it is believed that it would be impossible to establish works so near to each other as to prevent the landing of such a Force. Its defeat, therefore, should be effectually provided for. If the arrangement should be such as to make that result evident, it might be fairly concluded that the attempt would not be made, and thus we should accomplish, in the best mode possible, and with the least expense, the complete security of this important part of our Union, the great object of our system of defence for the whole.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_10"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_11">There are some other views of this subject, which, it is thought, will <span class="style_4">merit </span>particular attention, in deciding the point in question. Not being able to establish, a chain of posts, at least for the present, along the whole Coast, from the Rigolets to Dauphine Island, or on all the Islands between them ; at which point shall we begin ? Should an attack on the City be, anticipated, it cannot be doubted that an adequate force would immediately be ordered there for its defence. If the Enemy should despair of making an impression on the Works near the Town, it may be presumed that they would promptly decide to make an attempt, in the manner and in the line above suggested, between the Rigolets and the Bay of Mobile. It will be obvious, that the nearer the Fortification is erected to the Rigolets, with a view to this object, should it be on Cat or Ship Island, for example, the wider would the passage be left open, between that work and the Bay of Mobile, for such an enterprise. The main Army being drawn to New Orleans, would be ready to meet such an attempt, near the Rigolets, or at any other point not distant from the City. It is probable, therefore, that trie enemy, profiting of a fair wind, would make his attempt at tbe greatest distance compatible with his object, from that point, and at tbe Bay of Mobile, should there not be Works there of sufficient strength to prevent it. Should, however, strong Works be erected there, such as were sufficient not only for their own defence against any attack which might be made on them, but to hold a Force, connected with that which might be drawn from the neighbouring Country, capable of co-operating with the Force of the City, and which would doubtless be ordered to those Works, in the event of War; it would be dangerous for the Invading Force to land any where between the Rigolets and the Bay of Mobile, and to pass towards the Mississippi above the City, lest such a body might be thrown in its rear, as to cut off its retreat. These considerations establishing, at the mouth of the Bay such as would be adequate to all the pi If Fortifications were necessary, o Cities against the entry of large Shi Rivers, they would be of little use fc since that City cannot be approached s or in any other direction, by such Vess on it. In the Gulf, within our limits <span class="style_4">\ </span>acquired since these works were decidi no Bay or River, into which large Shi fence, therefore, against an attack froi would be altogether unnecessary, eithe Island, since Sloops of War only can But it is not for that purpose alone It is to provide, also, against a form'ul sea, the object of which may be to sha Should such small works be erected, i they would be sure to fall at once i and to be turned against us.<br /></p>
